# Bookshelf Application

## Overview

The Bookshelf Application is a simple web-based project designed to help users keep track of their books. Users can add books to their list, mark them as read or unread, and view their progress. The application also features a progress bar and data counter to provide a visual representation of the user's reading habits. All data is saved to and loaded from the browser's local storage, ensuring that the user's book list is preserved even after the browser is closed.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Users can add books to their list, specifying whether they have read them or not.
- **Mark as Read/Unread**: Users can easily move books between the read and unread categories.
- **Progress Bar**: A progress bar widget shows the percentage of books read.
- **Data Counter**: Displays the total number of books and the count of read and unread books.
- **Local Storage**: Automatically saves and loads user data from the browser's local storage.
